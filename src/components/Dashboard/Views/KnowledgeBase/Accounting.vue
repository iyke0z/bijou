        <li class="lead">What is a Ledger?</li>
        <p>
          (A). A ledger is the central repository of all financial transactions in a business.<br>
          (B). It contains categorized accounts, such as assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, and expenses.<br>
          (C). Each account records debits and credits for accurate financial tracking.<br>
          <strong>Example:</strong> A Cash account in a ledger might show a debit of ₦50,000 (cash received from sales) and a credit of ₦30,000 (cash paid for supplies), resulting in a ₦20,000 balance.
        </p>

        <li class="lead">What are the Types of Expenditures?</li>
        <p>
          (A). Expenditures are costs incurred to operate a business, divided into two main types:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>COGS (Cost of Goods Sold):</strong> Direct costs of producing or purchasing goods/services sold, e.g., raw materials, manufacturing labor.</li>
            <li><strong>OPEX (Operating Expenses):</strong> Indirect costs to run the business, e.g., rent, salaries (excluding production), marketing, utilities.</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Example:</strong> A bakery spends ₦20,000 on flour and labor (COGS) to bake bread and ₦15,000 on rent and electricity (OPEX) monthly.
        </p>

        <li class="lead">What is Expenditure Management?</li>
        <p>
          (A). Expenditure management involves planning, monitoring, and controlling spending to maximize efficiency and profitability.<br>
          (B). It ensures costs align with business goals and resources are used wisely.<br>
          <strong>Example:</strong> A retail store sets a ₦50,000 monthly budget for OPEX, reducing marketing costs by ₦5,000 to stay within budget while maintaining sales.
        </p>

        <li class="lead">What Do Key Financial Metrics Mean?</li>
        <p>
          Below are explanations of common financial metrics used in accounting:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Turnover:</strong> Total revenue or sales generated over a period. <em>Example:</em> A shop earns ₦100,000 from selling clothes in a month.</li>
            <li><strong>COGS (Cost of Goods Sold):</strong> Direct costs of producing goods/services sold. <em>Example:</em> The shop spends ₦60,000 on clothing inventory.</li>
            <li><strong>OPEX (Operating Expenses):</strong> Indirect costs of running the business. <em>Example:</em> The shop pays ₦15,000 for rent and utilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> Turnover minus COGS, showing production efficiency. <em>Example:</em> ₦100,000 (Turnover) - ₦60,000 (COGS) = ₦40,000.</li>
            <li><strong>Total Expenditure:</strong> Sum of COGS and OPEX. <em>Example:</em> ₦60,000 (COGS) + ₦15,000 (OPEX) = ₦75,000.</li>
            <li><strong>Net Profit:</strong> Turnover minus all expenses, indicating overall profitability. <em>Example:</em> ₦100,000 - ₦75,000 = ₦25,000.</li>
            <li><strong>Gross Profit Margin:</strong> Percentage of turnover remaining as gross profit, calculated as (Gross Profit / Turnover) × 100. <em>Example:</em> (₦40,000 / ₦100,000) × 100 = 40%.</li>
            <li><strong>Net Profit Margin:</strong> Percentage of turnover remaining as net profit, calculated as (Net Profit / Turnover) × 100. <em>Example:</em> (₦25,000 / ₦100,000) × 100 = 25%.</li>
            <li><strong>Cash Inflow:</strong> Total cash received, e.g., from sales or receivables. <em>Example:</em> The shop receives ₦60,000 in cash sales and ₦10,000 from credit customers.</li>
            <li><strong>Cash Outflow:</strong> Total cash paid out, e.g., for expenses or payables. <em>Example:</em> The shop pays ₦40,000 for inventory and ₦10,000 for rent.</li>
            <li><strong>Payables:</strong> Amounts owed to suppliers/creditors. <em>Example:</em> The shop owes ₦30,000 to a supplier for inventory.</li>
            <li><strong>Receivables:</strong> Amounts owed by customers. <em>Example:</em> Customers owe the shop ₦20,000 for credit purchases.</li>
            <li><strong>Owner Equity:</strong> Residual value of assets after liabilities. <em>Example:</em> The shop’s assets (₦200,000) minus liabilities (₦120,000) = ₦80,000 equity.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <li class="lead">What Are Key Financial Reports?</li>
        <p>
          Financial reports summarize a business’s financial performance and position:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Balance Sheet:</strong> Shows assets, liabilities, and owner equity at a specific time. <em>Example:</em> A business has ₦200,000 in assets (cash, inventory), ₦120,000 in liabilities (payables), and ₦80,000 in owner equity.</li>
            <li><strong>Profit & Loss Statement:</strong> Summarizes revenues, expenses, and profitability over a period. <em>Example:</em> A business reports ₦100,000 turnover, ₦75,000 total expenditure, and ₦25,000 net profit for a month.</li>
            <li><strong>Cash Flow Statement:</strong> Tracks cash inflows and outflows, showing liquidity. <em>Example:</em> A business has ₦70,000 cash inflow (sales, receivables) and ₦50,000 cash outflow (expenses, payables) in a month.</li>
          </ul>
